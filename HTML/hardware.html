		<P>A CPU also called the Central processing unit of a computer can be thought of as the actual brain of the computer. This piece of hardware is responsible for all of the Input/Output that you see and use, as well as processing all of the instructions given to it (this is where it get's its name.)</P>
		<P>Most modern CPUs would be refered to as microprocessors because of the small scale of these newer chips. This is how most new smartphones as well as tablets and new "2 in 1 PC's" work these days. </P>
