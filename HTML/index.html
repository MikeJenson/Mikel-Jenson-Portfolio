		<H2>A little bit of information about my film obsession</H2>
		<P> I have been very interested in films and movies for quite some time. I've seen everything from Monty Python to mission impossible. My favorite films to watch right now are more intipendent films rather than big budget blockbusters, because I feel like those films have more to say. I also very much enjoy documentary film, because it's very interesting to jump into someone elses life and see how they live it. </P>
		<P> To help do something about this film obsession, Last year I attempted to watch every film on the AFI Top 100 list. While I did not watch some of the drama films I have now seen a huge percentage of the AFI Top films. The ones that stand out to me, in no particular order, can be found below. </P>
		<H2>List of films that stand out to me from the AFI top 100:</H2>
		<UL>
			<LI>Some Like it Hot</LI>
			<LI>It Happeded One Night</LI>
			<LI>Laurence of Arabia</LI>
			<LI>Ben-Hur</LI>
			<LI>Singin in the Rain</LI>
			<LI>Sunset Boulevard</LI>
			<LI>Doctor Strangelove</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>I could go on and on, or you can look at this list yourself at <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies_(10th_Anniversary_Edition)">This page</A>.</P>
		<H2>Conclusion</H2>
		<P>I would suggest for anyone interested in film, to look at the above page and try to watch some of the films on this list. They are on this list for a reason and I think it will change the way you watch films forever.</P>
