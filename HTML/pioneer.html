		<P>Alan Turing was born in 1912 in England. He studied at the "Government Code and Cypher School" where he learned codebreaking. It was here that he built the "Bombe". This machine was used to crack the code of the German "Enigma Machine". The Enigma Machine was used to encrypt messages to other German bases.</P>
		<P>The Bombe would crack codes by punching in the coded messages as if it was setup on several different enigma machines at the same time. </P>
